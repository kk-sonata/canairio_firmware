** is possible that the **current firmware supports more boards** and sensors. Also you can choose the sensor brand or type on the CanAirIO Android app.


# Installation alternatives

We have different alternatives for load the current firmware. In order of complexity they are:

## Via CanAirIO Web Installer (RECOMMENDED)

If you already have a ESP32 board, you can test our CanAirIO firmware on one click, with our web installer:  

[![video_2021-11-13_23-36-10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/423856/141661066-0fafcaa9-98b4-419b-b1e7-4371f3cb99b8.gif)](https://canair.io/installer.html)

## Via CanAirIO loader

You will able to install the last version of CanAirIO firmware with internet updates via a simple Arduino sketch that it will doing all for you, you only need to use the official [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [Arduino Droid app for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=name.antonsmirnov.android.arduinodroid2&hl=en&gl=US) for load this [simple sketch](https://github.com/hpsaturn/esp32-canairio-loader/blob/master/canairio_loader/canairio_loader.ino). Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/hpsaturn/esp32-canairio-loader) or follow the next [YouTube video guide](https://youtu.be/FjfGdnTk-rc) for Android OTG installation alternative.

## Via binaries 

You can download the last firmware version in [releases](https://github.com/kike-canaries/esp32-hpma115s0/releases) section. Download the last **production** release from `assets` section, for example: 

![releases assets](images/assets.jpg)

please uncompress the zip file and connect your CanAirIO device to your USB and execute the next command for upload the firmware to your model board, for example to a TTGO_T7 board you should run the next commands:

### Linux and MacOSx

``` bash
unzip canairio_rev414_20190829.zip
cd canairio_installer
./install.sh canairio_TTGO_T7_rev839.bin
```
**Note**: you need python2 or python3 with pyserial in your system.

### Windows

Please read the [Espressif Uploader](https://canair.io/docs/firmware_upload.html#espressif-uploader) section in the main documentation for details to load the firmware via the oficial **Espressif Download Tool** in Windows.

### OTA WAN updates

CanAirIO has two channels for remote OTA updates of your device, production channel and development channel. With that you don't need again install the firmware for any update, all here is automatic and you only need have WiFi enable on your device for receive this firmware updates.

If you want the last testing updates, please choose in the previous step the development firmware (zip file with **dev** name), and upload it to your board.

### OTA LAN alternative

After USB binary installation, you will able to send OTA updates to any board supported, like this:

``` bash
./install.sh ota canairio_d1mini_rev414_20190829.bin
```

Also you can specify the IP address:

```bash
./install.sh ota canairio_xxx.bin 192.168.1.10
```

More details and options of `CanAirIO Installer` [here](https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_firmware/tree/master/releases/installer/canairio_installer#readme)


## Via PlatformIO (Compiling on Linux, Mac or Windows)

Please install first [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/) open source ecosystem for IoT development compatible with **Arduino** IDE and its command line tools (Windows, MacOs and Linux). Also, you may need to install [git](http://git-scm.com/) in your system.

For the **default** board `TTGO_TDISPLAY` (CanAirIO Bike), clone and upload firmware via USB cable:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_firmware
cd canairio_firmware
pio run --target upload
```

For a specific firmware for example for a TTGO-T7 board, only change the last line for:

``` bash
pio run -e TTGO_T7 --target upload
```

## Via Docker

First build the Docker image using the following command line:

```bash
docker build -t canairio_pio:master .
```

This build a basic compiler image with all PlatformIO stuff. For build the project you only needs now run:

```bash
./docker_build run
```

### Building Installer

You can build `CanAirIO Installer` zip package with all binaries of all board flavors running the next command:

``` bash
./build all && ./build installer
```

The directory output is in: `releases/installer`  
Also the binaries flavors directory: `releases/binaries/`

More details and options of `CanAirIO Installer` [here](https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_firmware/tree/master/releases/installer/canairio_installer#readme)


### Troubleshooting

If you have some issues with Bluetooth library internals, or libraries issues, please upgrade all frameworks and tools on PlatformIO:

``` bash
pio update
sudo pio upgrade
pio lib update
```

And maybe clean all caches:

``` bash
pio run -t clean
rm -rf .pio
```

If you want clear all ESP32 preferences and flash variables in your board, please execute before:

```bash
./install.sh erase /dev/ttyUSB0
```
